# Interactive Gamelan — Uniform Keys + Stacked Sharps

- **All keys same size** (whites and sharps).
- Sharps are **stacked on top** of the white row (overlapping) for a true keyboard look.
- Uses your **real gamelan image** from `assets/gamelan.png`. You can still upload another image at runtime.

### Files
- `index.html` — UI and layout
- `main.js` — ultra-low-latency WebAudio engine
- `assets/gamelan.png` — your uploaded image (copied)

### Deploy
Place all files in your repo root and enable GitHub Pages (Deploy from a branch → `/ (root)`).
