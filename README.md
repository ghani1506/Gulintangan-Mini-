# Interactive Gamelan â€” Real Image + Piano Layout

Use your **own gamelan photo** for each key. You can:
- Upload at runtime (no repo asset required), OR
- Place a file at `assets/gamelan.jpg` in your repo, which will load by default.

## How to use a custom image
1. Open the page and click **ðŸ“· Upload Gamelan Image**. Choose any JPG/PNG.
2. The photo becomes the background for all pads instantly.

### Optional (GitHub Pages asset)
- Create a folder `assets` in your repo.
- Add `gamelan.jpg` inside it.
- The page will use it automatically even without uploading.

Other features remain the same: ultraâ€‘low latency WebAudio, preâ€‘rendered buffers, keyboard control (`Z S X D C V G B H N J M ,`).
